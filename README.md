## Overview

In this project, we'll build a sticky navigation bar that stays fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls down. We'll achieve this using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and CSS styles dynamically.

## Features

- Sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down.
- Smooth scrolling to anchor links within the page when clicking on navigation items.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the sticky navigation in action.
2. Scroll down the page, and observe the navigation bar sticking to the top of the viewport.
3. Click on the navigation items to smoothly scroll to the respective sections on the page.
